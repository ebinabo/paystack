Verify Invoice
}
\details{
Note that a key is added called pending_amount when you fetch an invoice. This is because when paying for an invoice, you can choose to pay part but not all. Whenever a successful transaction is made, the key updates to reveal whatâ€™s left of the invoice to pay. As a rule, the UI (frontend, or POS) should not allow payment of an amount greater than the pending amount.
